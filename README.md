# Self-Service System Happy Herbivore

This project is a self-service ordering system created as a school assignment for a fictional company, _Happy Herbivore_. The system is divided into three main parts:

1. API (`/server`)

   - Supplies product data to the front-end.
   - Handles incoming orders by storing them in the database.
   - Uses WebSockets to broadcast new orders to the dashboard in real time.

2. Front-end (`/react`)

   - A user-friendly application designed for customers to browse products and place orders.
   - Provides a seamless ordering experience on a touchscreen or kiosk.

3. Back-end _(Not built yet)_
   - A dashboard accessible only to employees.
   - Displays incoming orders and relevant statistics for order management.

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (or a package manager combined with a TypeScript runtime of choice, this guide uses Bun because it's an all-in-one sollution.)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
